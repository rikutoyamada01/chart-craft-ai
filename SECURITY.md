# Security Policy for Circuit Craft AI Project

Security is a top priority for the Circuit Craft AI project and its community. ðŸ”’

Please read the following guidelines on how to report vulnerabilities. ðŸ‘‡

## Supported Versions

Currently, only the latest stable version or release of the Circuit Scribe project is officially supported for security updates.

We encourage all users and contributors to keep their development environments and deployed applications updated to the latest versions. Regularly updating helps you benefit from the newest features, bug fixes, and crucial **security patches**.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability within the Circuit Scribe project, or even if you are unsure, we urge you to report it immediately.

Please send an email with a detailed description of the potential vulnerability to:
[your-team-security-email@example.com]

When reporting, please try to be as explicit as possible. Include:
-   A clear description of the vulnerability.
-   Steps to reproduce the issue.
-   Any example code or configurations that help demonstrate the problem.
-   The potential impact of the vulnerability.

Our team will review your report thoroughly and get back to you as soon as possible.

## Public Discussions

We kindly request that you refrain from publicly discussing any potential security vulnerabilities until they have been addressed. ðŸ™Š

Discussing vulnerabilities privately allows us to investigate, confirm, and implement a fix before the information becomes public, thereby limiting the potential impact as much as possible.
